This is my attempt at replicating the ZURI website... Unfortunately I havent been able to learn frameworks but this is my attempt using just HTML, CSS...
By the side I'm super grateful to ZURI for all I was able to learn being a part of this cohort. It just showed me what I'm ale to do if i set my mind to it...
